  <h2>Welcome to my first web page :)</h2>
  <h3>Adventures of a baby coder</h3>
  <p>Learning to build websites is my first step in world domination.  How do I plan on doing that, you ask? Well I can't tell you otherwise I'd have to kill you</p>
  <br>However, here are some of my goals unrelated to world domination
  <ul>
    <li>Build a cool travel app</li>
    <li>Be the new Colgate girl</li>
    <li>Keep a succulent alive for more than 37 days</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Connect with me on Linkedin and you might end up on my "good" list when I take over the world:
